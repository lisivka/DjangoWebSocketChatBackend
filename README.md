      can
      get python [here](https://www.python.org).
    - Docker should be installed on your computer. If it's not installed yet, refer to
      the [official Docker instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. **Environment Configuration**
    - Clone the repository
       [racoon-project](https://github.com/DJWOMS/DjangoWebSocketChatBackEnd.git)
    - cd into your the cloned repo as such:
        ```
            cd Racoon-Project
        ```
    - Create and fire up your virtual environment:
        ```
            python -m venv venv
            venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` template and fill in the required environment variables.
    - Install the dependencies needed to run the app:
        ```
            pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Running with Docker Compose**
    - Open the terminal in the root directory of the project.
    - Run the command: `docker-compose up --build`.
    - After successful container startup, open a web browser and go to
      [DRF API](http://127.0.0.1:8000/), [DRF API Documentation](http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/)  to access the server.
4. **Stopping the Project**
    - To stop the project, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal, then execute the command: `docker-compose down`.
> [!TIP]
> ## _Important Commands_
> - `docker-compose up --build`:  Initiates the project in development mode, building and starting all defined services.
> - `docker ps`: Lists currently running containers.
> - `docker ps -a`: Lists all containers, including both running and stopped ones.
> - `docker-compose down`: Halts and removes containers as defined in the Docker Compose file.
> - `docker system prune -a`: Clears unused Docker objects such as containers, volumes, networks, and images, freeing up
    disk space.
> - `docker-compose exec backend python manage.py [command]`: Runs Django commands within the backend container.
    Replace [command] with specific Django management commands like makemigrations, migrate, createsuperuser, etc.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## _Additional Information_
> #### When you start the project for the first time, use the command:
>> `docker-compose up --build`: Launch the project in development mode.`
> #### In the future, to launch the project, use the command:
>> `docker-compose up`
